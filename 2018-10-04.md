    - Self-sufficient villages were unable to pay the tax because they didn't make money, people moved to cities
  - Bahamut's light is the main benefit of Aasimar rule
- We ask Nathan to bring a solo Aasimar to the hills where we are hiding and plan to dominate mind on the Aasimar

- THE BATTLE BEGINS
- We kill the Aasimar quickly and waste time debating what to do next
- Five other Aasimar show up!
- We plan to hop into Drussilia's hole and tree stride away
- Right before we start climbing in the portable hole Druisillia observes that there's no trees nearby, guess we're fighting!
- OMG so much fighting! Druisillia is surrounded and knocked unconscious and Eir the Valkyrie dies but we manage to kill them all
- After they die Vinjano (a vampire) walks out from behind a hill
- Vinjano apologizes for Luciano's behavior 
- Vampires don't want the staff 
- They have a vampire wizard who's working on a spell to banish all Aasimar back to the celestial plane
- They also give us a coffin of holding to store corpses - they need 100 Aasimar corpses for the spell
- Vampires offer us assistance and information - schematics about the castle in the capital
