- We lure the inn keeper to our room and dominate mind him
- Nathan Arbukle - mid 40s inn keeper
- He lived in Mountwend for 2 years, previously Eastern Isles (Stirling)
- Stirling was previously his home
- More info from him:
  - 5 years ago vampires killed everyone in Mountwend
  - Vampires did not take responsibility
  - Aasimar came to Eastern Isles and there was a war between Legion of Dusk and Aasimar
  - Aasimar took control of Eastern Isles
  - Some vampires are still in hiding in Renwick or Woodvale
  - No one has seen a vampire in 6 months
  - Crackdown on smuggling happened 1.5 years ago, Aasimar heavily control sea travel
  - Krakens - destroyed by the Merfolk but the Merfolk have returned to the celestial plane
  - All towns pay taxes to Tarn
  - Leader of the Aasimar - Emperor Bellum
  - Aasimar killed the vampires to root out all evil - vampires, crimson admirals, gangs, thugs, pirates, thieves
  - What happened in the last 5 years?
    - Less executions - everyone who opposes the Aasimar is dead
    - As gambling houses closed more executions occurred
    - Renamed the planet from Sunshard to Bahamus
    - New taxes - taxes are based on the number of people in a village
    - Self-sufficient villages were unable to pay the tax because they didn't make money, people moved to cities
  - Bahamut's light is the main benefit of Aasimar rule
- We ask Nathan to bring a solo Aasimar to the hills where we are hiding and plan to dominate mind on the Aasimar
- The Aasimar is told there is a body and they arrive to find Grommash writhing on the ground
- When we attempt to dominate them the Aasimar uses their legendary resistence to avoid the dominate monster
- The Aasimar lets out a massive shout and summons all the Aasimar from Mountwend to them
- THE BATTLE BEGINS
- We kill the Aasimar quickly and waste time debating what to do next
- Five other Aasimar show up!
- We plan to hop into Drussilia's hole and tree stride away
- Right before we start climbing in the portable hole Druisillia observes that there's no trees nearby, guess we're fighting!
- OMG so much fighting! Druisillia is surrounded and knocked unconscious and Eir the Valkyrie dies but we manage to kill them all
- After they die Vinjano (a vampire) walks out from behind a hill
- Vinjano apologizes for Luciano's behavior 
- Vampires don't want the staff 
- They have a vampire wizard who's working on a spell to banish all Aasimar back to the celestial plane
- They also give us a coffin of holding to store corpses - they need 100 Aasimar corpses for the spell
- Vampires offer us assistance and information - schematics about the castle in the capital
- There are more than 100 Aasimar in the capital (Tarn)
