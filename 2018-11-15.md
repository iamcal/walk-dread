- We head over to Fyldor
- Notice a church like building with many pigeons
- An Aasimar is near the center of town
- There's a construction site and we discover they are building a church
- Another Aasimar is guarding the construction site
- We shove the Aasimar into the coffin and now have them stuck between the ground and the coffin but can't move the coffin
- We discover the church under construction has a safe room
- Druisillia investigates the pigeon nesting ground and doesn't find much
- Dominate an Aasimar (Orum)
  * Why did you come to this plane? Profit and power
  * They did not know that portal was now closed
  * "We are turnt, we are fallen"
  * They would believe that there was good Aasimar closing the portal
  * They wanted to get away from the good of the celestial plane and find a place and control it
  * How would you get 100 dead Aasimar? Find a place where they are gathering and set them on fire. Wait if ashes don't count then I'm not sure
  * The other Aasimar is named Karen, the other is Aasulin
  * 10 minutes until Aasimar suffocate
  * We ask about ways to get small groups of Aasimar; reports of vampires could bring a few Aasimar over but one time deal
  * Aasimar really like: obedience
  * There are ranks in the Aasimar; grunt, lietenants, captains, legionnaires (one per region), emperor
  * The dragon was an ally in their rift with Bahamut. The dragon was the guardian of dragon.
  * The fallen Aasimar are each out for themselves
  * We try to find a way to get a Leginonnaire here or us solo with a Legionnaire but can't come up with anything
- Narthan (a human) is given to Aelar
- We go and kill Karen the Aasimar scientist working in the fields
- We head over to Barrington and set the town on fire
- The Aasimar flee into the tunnel under Orum's suggestion 
- The first 2 run into the coffin as fleeing. We push one in and then we are able to get the other two into the coffin but they are harder as they saw their friends fall into it
- We head to Renwick after we are informed that the legionnaire will discover us soon so we head there first
