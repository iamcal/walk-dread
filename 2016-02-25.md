# Session 8 - Birth of Zar

![Map](images/rivergard_keep.jpg)

Our party surveyed the wreckage of our last battle and decided to journey onward to Rivergard Keep disguised as the priest and band of mercenaries we had just slaughtered. Raz donned the robe from the priest we had killed and we headed west towards the river.

Upon arriving at the river we found it quiet. However the river was ~0.5 miles wide and there were no boats in sight. We headed north along the river with the hope of finding a barge to cross the river closer to Rivergard Keep. Eventually we arrived at a point across from the keep but there were still no boats or people to be found. Druisillia had the wise idea to head into the hills in search of a possible secret underground passage below the river. Together we ventured into the hills and soon after spotted an ominously large number of crows circling something due east.

The possibility of more cult members and general murder intrigued us so we ventured towards the crows. There we found a destroyed caravan and an area littered with bodies and craters. Further inspection revealed the craters to have been caused by powerful earth magic. From the battle site we could see cairns atop a nearby hill. Suspecting there to be bodies to loot Fear ran up the hill to the cairns. Sure enough inside the cairns there were bodies which he searched (oddly not searching the entrails this time). In addition to some minor treasure the bodies were interesting in that they were bug bears bodies and had the symbol of an earth cult on shields with the bodies. We also found some evidence that suggested this may have been the site that the delegation was ambushed at (what was this?).

Given a new cult being and the presence of bug bears we decided to abandon our previous disguise plan and instead just proceed as mercenaries potentially seeking employment. Aelar then used his pathfinding skills to identify a trail left by a group of 30 bug bears + humans leaving the scene of the battle. We followed the trail west until we came to the river again where we found some boats moored. We waited for the cover of darkness and crossed the river by boat taking a path directly due west. We found no boats there nor a continuation of the trail. Guessing the party we were previously tracking had proceeded south by boat to Rivergard Keep we snuck that way along land in the dark.

Arriving at Rivergard Keep we found four guards standing outside the keep and the inside of the castle appeared lit and active. Raz decided to sneak around the castle under the cover of darkness and discover if there were any weak points. Seizing a moment of opportunity he decided to throw a roap and sneak up a castle wall beside the keep. Raz was able to sneak across the wall and kill a guard who was standing atop the entrance to the castle in one blow. Perhaps feeling a bit confident at this point Raz decided to grab his climbing gear and venture into the keep at one end of the wall. He pried open a door to find some washing staff who saw him and exclaimed. He then snuck into the next room which turned out to be the kitchen. The kitchen staff were also confused but responded well to Raz's bluffs about being lost. Finally Raz exited the kitchen into the Great Hall. There sitting at a table covered in documents were Jolliver, two Reavers, and a priest discussing matters of the cult. Raz boldly decided to attempt to sneak out of the room via a door on the other side and to do so he had to cross directly in front of Jolliver. Jolliver quickly saw Raz and asked who he was, Raz attempt to feign that he was a mercenary and warn of an attack on the walls failed. Jolliver instructed his guards to seize Raz and at this point Raz remembered his wand which had a spell of misdirection (making him invisible and summoning a double (Zar)). Zar ran out the door that Raz had entered from, jumped off the wall and ran off into the forest. All the people in the room ran after him and eventually guards started running out of the castle as well.

At this point the rest of the party still outside the castle noticed the commotion and decided to use whatever was happening as a distraction. The party climbed the wall and shortly afterwards heard Raz's voice coming from the door to the keep. They quickly figured out what was going on and then the murdering began. We entered a nearby tower and quickly killed 3 bug bears. Exiting the tower we spotted Jolliver standing on the wall atop the gate, we went back through the Great Room towards Jolliver on the wall. We attempted to sneak up on him but were only partially successful and then shortly after the battle began he turned into a Were-boar (which was somewhat surprising but we were well equipped to murder all types). We made quick work of him and a number of reavers, mercenaries, and priests that remained in the castle. At this point the interior of the castle seemed quiet and we lowered the gate to trap guards who had run after Zar outside the walls.

As things quieted down the servants from the Great Hall exited and thanked us for saving them (which honestly we weren't sure we were going to do yet). They then told us about a secret room that could be entered from the Great Hall. We returned to the great hall and found the secret room that led us downstairs to a room overlooking the water that appeared to be Jollivers bedroom. More interestingly there was an underground river below the castle and there was a boat moored at a dock. This river appeared to head east to the larger river we had crossed and west into the hills.

We reemerged into the courtyard from underground and found there was still a sermon going on in the chapel. After much debate between the options of burn, murder, or torture we decided to enter the chapel. We entered quietly as acolytes and took our seats in the pews next to two reavers and listened as the priestess gave her sermon. She preached of the water god Ol Hydra and of Gar Shatterkeel the man who had brought this cult into existence. While listening to this sermon Fear casually placed his hand on the shoulder of the reaver next to him and cast Inflict Wounds causing him to explode. Obviously this alarmed the other worshippers. We made quick work of the other reaver and then forced the priestess to surrender. Under questioning though she was unwilling to give the location of Gar and we were preparing to torture her for information. Then suddenly Ol Hydra appeared in the flesh (thanks to Raz summoning an illusion) and the Great Wave herself commanded the priestess to surrender instructing her Gar was a false prophet and she should betray him. At this point the priestess let us know that Gar was in the House of the Wave which a temple under the summer hills. Overcome with emotions she slit her own throat.
