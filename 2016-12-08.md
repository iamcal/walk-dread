# Session 17 - Some exposition at last

The party were debating whether to rest before taking on the Manticore, when it appeared from the cave 50 feet away. The manticore was quickly killed (how did the air cult have any trouble with this?) and Fear took the head as proof. Also in the cave were some Orc skeletons and boxes of china plates and bolts of cloth.

On returning to the spire, Thurl was impressed with the Manticore head (seriously?), but knew nothing about the china. The party kept the cloth hidden, in case it had any value. Thurl also had no idea about the dead bodies, not the body they had found with the vulture.

A long discussion with Thurl ensued, while the party debated whether to join the cult. Thurl revealed that the feathergale knights want to get into the temple under their headquarters. The temple can only be entered with a magic key, made from 4 fragments, each of which is held by one of the cults. He showed his fragment off. He had not heard of the Elder Elemental Eye. He revealed that the air cult has a prophet (Aerisi Kalinoth) is inside the temple; she gained access using a magical weapon which can also act as a key. Each of the cults has a prophet of their own, which their own weapon/key.

## What we know about the cults

| Element | Water | Earth | Fire | Air |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | --- |
|Location |Rivergard Keep |Sacred Stone Monastery |Scarlet Moon Hall |Feathergale Spire |
|Leader |Jolliver Grimjaw |Hellenrae |Dude with a pipe? |Thurl Merosska, Feathergale Knights |
|Cult | Cult of the Crushing Wave |Cult of the Black Earth |Cult of the Eternal Flame |Cult of the Howling Hatred |
|Prophet |Gar Shatterkeel? |? |Vannifer |Aerisi Kalinoth |
|Prince |Olhydra? |? |Imix |Yan-C-Bin |


The air cult hate the earth and water cults, but are friendly with the fire cult.

Thurl wants the air cult to be the ones that let their Elemental Prince/Prime be the one that breaks through to this world. Whichever does will rule the world and they insist that they are the only non-evil cult. They will bring their prince through by creating a Devastation Orb, which can siphon power from an Elemental Node. There are 4 Elemental Nodes in the temples, one for each cult. The Devastation Orb will cause destruction and the more destruction that happens, the more likely their god is able to make it through. This does not sound great.

Thurl has never met the prophet Aerisi Kalinoth. She is deep inside the temple working on a Devastation Orb and spoke to him (and all the wind cultists) through dreams/visions. Aerisi Kalinoth and Queen Carbonara are the same person.

The letter we found was to Thurl from the queen/Aerisi and said: happy to hear about your victory over earth cult, happy about noble waterdeep captured, keep an eye on the sacred earth cult what they're up to. Seems likely the air cult kidnapped the missing delegation at that battleground we found early on.

Thurl also mentions a Drow called Vizeran DeVir. This person created all the weapons and nodes.

The party go to sleep to get a long rest, planning to join the cult in the morning.

In the morning, Thurl asks us to fetch another keyshard to help the cult. The party reveals that they already have the other 3 shards. Thurl tries to take them. When the party resists he calls for guards, so the party immediately attack him, shouting at him to call off his attack the whole time.

He is killed, along with multiple cultists.

With the fourth key fragment in hand, they combime to form a single magic key. Immediately after, the party start hearing a voice in their head (via a spell): "Adventurers I am in Zeladun, you are kill.. Arch Mage Drow worships elder elemental eye. Trying to figure out where he is. Yartar has a devastation orb owned by a constable that is being auctioned."

The party decide to bail and head to Yartar to find the Devastation Orb. On their way out, they try to recruit Sarva and fail. They hide under a rock briefly as Hippogrifs search the area.

Returning to Red Larch, they buy and eat a whole hog. Aelar commissions a harness for his centaur friend. The next day they buy horses and set off up north, heading for Yartar via Triboar.

Passing through Westbridge, they find it was attacked by Hobgoblins they made off with horses. The barkeep kept the bar (Harvest Inn) open during the attack. Repeated storms with direct lines of rain; rain just ends at a line (_I don't know what this means_).

Triboar has guards posted outside the city, but the party are let into the town and find an inn and stable their horses.
