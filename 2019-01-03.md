## Session 42 - THE END

- We decide to try and meet Crovor the legionnaire in Tarn
- The plan is to act as "management consultants" who turned around Renwick
- The plan seems reasonable except people never show up unannounced
- What if Renwick has fallen and we are returning to get reinforcements to take it back
- We travel in luxury on a boat provided by Talbott 
- The plan is:
  - Talbott brings us in as prisoners
  - We are in the portable hole with bone snorkels
  - Tablott leaves Rian in the prison cell
  - Tells Crovor he's got a secret prisoner and Renwick has fallen
  - Bring Crovor down for interrogation
  - Bring us out of the bag and fight and then dominate
- Grommash helps row us up the Fey Channel
- Anais casts an image of herself rowing
- We take the boat to the bridge and then have to disembark
- We buy a cart and filled with supplies and hide the coffin in it
- Change of plans we will go in through the dungeon hole
- We enter the tunnel on the southwestern side of the city
- Rian puts us in the hole and Grommash carries the coffin disguised as a guard for Tablot
- We make it to cell despite the guards calling this "highly irregular"
- Crovor is accompanied by 4 Aasimar to the cell
- "I'm in the corner watching them torture, whooao"
- We able to defeat them all after stalling and Crovor is dominated
- He orders the remaining Aasimar into the coffin
- We give the vampire wizard the coffin and he takes 10 minutes to cast a spell
- He casts LEVEL 9 spell!!1!
- The Aasimar in front of us bend and then disappear in front of us
- The world is freed from Aasimar
- We retire from adventuring and begin new lives on Sunworld:
  - Aelar opens up a bar/brothel called La Bete Sauvage catering to elves
  - Druisillia returns to the Feywild to live our her days in the woods
  - Fear roams the world murdering, stealing, and fashioning new cloaks from the skin of his victims
  - Raz skulked around in the shadows, briefly playing at Robin Hood by stealing from and fucking with the rich folks in the city
  - Anais opens a school for the study of ancient religious texts
  - Grommash joined the crew of boat we rowed in on and became the lead rower, and row row rowed that boat until his final sunset
- Roll credits
- Post credits sequence; Anais starts a religion and rounds up the crew becomes her acolytes and recreate her violent religion in
  the real world ðŸ’–
