# Session 12 - Aelar brings all the wargs to the yard

With a flurry of hands Fear cast a spell and unlocked the room we knew as M16. We crowded in to find an old Lich inspecting one of many tomes stored in the room. After introducing ourselves to Mr Lich and found like us he had some animosity towards the cults in the area. He feared the cults were capable of summoning the Elder Elemental Eye (dun-dun-dunnn). This elder elemental eye was described as a being of pure destruction that could destroy this world.

We considered our options and decided that despite our general appetite for destruction we would rather focus it on these self-aggrandizing cults than this world as a whole. After agreeing to pursue the destruction of the earth, wind, fire (and air) cults Mr Lich gave us some more interesting information:

* We did not meet Gar Shatterkeel in the water cult's lair, but rather a Marid
* There are two other cult bases Scarlett Moon Hall (fire) to the north, and Feathergale Spire (air) to the west by north west
* Key fragments unlock doors under each of the cult keeps
* The best brothel in the area is in Red Larch (but is clearly basic)
* Mr Lich's "real name" is Renwick or something.

We headed north to Scarlett Moon Hall and shortly after leaving the monastery setup camp for the night. Aelar drew first watch and stayed up working on sketches of himself. Shortly into his watch he heard some noises and woke the remainder of the party. They were quickly besieged by 4 hell hounds. The battle started with Drusillia summoning thorns to entrap the hell hounds. This looked really cool, but in hindsight was more of a pain in the ass (although she forgot she could have dismissed it?). After a touch and go battle we were able to kill all the hellhounds, catching the last one with an arrow as it tried to flee.

After resting again to recover we were able to follow the trail of the hell hounds to Scarlett Moon Hall. We came upon a very hazy area with a 100 ft tall stone tower near the centre. It was actively under construction and was surround by crumbling walls and ~10 encampments.

We stopped to discuss strategies and it was decided that Aelar would sneak up and try to ascertain who was in the encampments. He successfully snuck close to one encampment and discovered is was home to 3 hooded figures and a couple of wargs. As Aelar departed, one of the wargs suddenly caught a trace of of his masculine yet sensual odor and chased after him into the haze. Aelar ran back towards the rest of the group but couldn't make it before the warg caught up with him. Using his quick thinking (a skill people sometimes forget about when looking at his god-like body) Aelar shot an arrow towards his compatriots. The arrow flew true and struck Drusillia. When she pulled the arrow from her skin she noticed the artfully drawn penis on the arrow and knew immediately it came from Aelar. She cursed loudly (presumably at the wargs) and they rushed into battle to aid Aelar.

When they arrived Aelar was battling the 2 wargs and 3 bug bears were just arriving on seen. These creatures were easily dispatched, but they were able to shout as they died, and more members of the encampments started heading our way. After some debate we decide to lure them into a trap. Things go south very quickly in the "trap" we sent for these followers which turn out to include two fire acolytes and a brown bear. Quickly Daar and Drusillia are knocked unconscious due to fireballs and the remainder us are weakened. Thankfully we have killed all but one of the acolytes. Aelar (himself heavily wounded) then rushes over to the unconcious Fear and heals him so he can attack the remaining acolyte. Fear rises to the challenge but manages to misfire while casting his spell and kills Aelar. After a bit of close call Daar, Azaghal, and Fear are able to finish off the remaining acolyte and we retrieve two flame resistant cloaks from them.

The party makes the decision to head off into the hills for a long rest but were able to notice a few shadowy figures seeming to follow them in the distance.
